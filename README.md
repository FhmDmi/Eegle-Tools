# Eegle-Tools
This repository contains all the scripts, utilities, and workflows I have used while working with the **Eegle.jl** package and the **BCI FII Corpus** gathering a large amount of databases. The goal is to provide reproducible tools and examples for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, visualization, and machine learning experiments related to BCI.
